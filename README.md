# Android on Browser

The screen of my Moto G is dead, so I've made a little app that captures the screen on my phone and
pipes the output on a node server, so I can see what's on screen via adb.

Going to http://localhost:5000/ will show the phone screen and allow to interact with the phone
using a mouse (tap and swipe).

# To-do

- I have to translate all the keyboard inputs to adb commands
- A better and faster way to capture the screen
